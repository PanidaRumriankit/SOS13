If SOS14 is coming and you have no idea how to write Elab problems. You can use these Elab links to see my Elab codes.
However, don't modifly my code only modifly your own code. It will affects SOS13 problems if you modify it. (I'm not sure.) 
Ichi will come to your house at 5 a.m. if you modifly it.*/
